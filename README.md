# Causality-For-Earth-science - A Review on Time-series and Spatiotemporal Causality Methods

## Abstract

This survey paper covers the breadth and depth of time-series and spatiotemporal causality methods,  and their applications in Earth science. The paper first introduces the concepts of causal discovery and causal inference, followed by the underlying causal assumptions, evaluation techniques and key terminologies of the two domain areas. The paper elicits the various state-of-the-art methods introduced for time-series and spatiotemporal causal analysis along with their strengths and limitations. The paper further describes the existing applications of several methods for answering specific Earth science questions such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, teleconnections, etc. Our survey paper will benefit the Earth science community interested in taking an AI-driven approach to study the causality of different dynamic and thermodynamic processes as we present the open challenges and opportunities in performing causality-based Earth science study. It will also serve as a primer for data science researchers interested in data-driven causal study as we share a holistic list of resources, such as Earth science datasets (synthetic, simulated and observational data) and open source tools for causal analysis.
