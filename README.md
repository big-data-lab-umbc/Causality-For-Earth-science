# Causality-For-Earth-science - A Review on Time-series and Spatiotemporal Causality Methods

## Abstract

This survey paper covers the breadth and depth of time-series and spatiotemporal causality methods,  and their applications in Earth science. The paper first introduces the concepts of causal discovery and causal inference, followed by the underlying causal assumptions, evaluation techniques and key terminologies of the two domain areas. The paper elicits the various state-of-the-art methods introduced for time-series and spatiotemporal causal analysis along with their strengths and limitations. The paper further describes the existing applications of several methods for answering specific Earth science questions such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, teleconnections, etc. Our survey paper will benefit the Earth science community interested in taking an AI-driven approach to study the causality of different dynamic and thermodynamic processes as we present the open challenges and opportunities in performing causality-based Earth science study. It will also serve as a primer for data science researchers interested in data-driven causal study as we share a holistic list of resources, such as Earth science datasets (synthetic, simulated and observational data) and open source tools for causal analysis.


## Datasets for Causal Analysis


Title: Synthetic, simulated, and real world datasets used for causal analysis}

Dataset|Description|Data Type|Causal Category|Dataset Type
---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:
CausalWorld | This open-source causal structure learning benchmarking data generation platform contains a robotic environment manipulation dataset for different tasks. The generated datasets represent different causal structures of interacting objects like robot and object masses, colors, sizes, etc. Different causal studies like do-interventions, counterfactual situations, structure learning, inference, etc. can be performed and evaluated using this platform. | Time-series| Causal Discovery/Inference| Realistic & Simulated   
[Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/basic_causal_structures_additive_noise)  | Contains six synthetic datasets representing different causal structures. The time series datasets are generated using a nonlinear function of cause variables, linear self-causation and additive Gaussian noise. | Time series | Causal Discovery| Synthetic 
FLAIRS  | This resource contains 22 simulated time series datasets. All datasets contain 20 continuous variables and 1000 time points with a lag of 1 and 3 time units.  | Time series| Causal Discovery | Synthetic
Diffusion Data | This dataset contains 4000 samples of diffusion-based spatiotemporal images. The dataset contains 3 variables including treatment, time-varying confounder, and (factual and counterfactual) outcomes. | Spatiotemporal | Causal Inference | Synthetic 
North American Mesoscale (NAM) | Generated by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) using the WRF Non-Hydrostatic Mesoscale Model. This is a spatiotemporal dataset of 12km resolution covering the continental United States and the data frequency is every 6 hours from 2012-01-01 00:00 to 2023-10-15 18:00. Different properties of Air Temperature, Geopotential Height, Humidity, Sea Level Pressure, Snow, Surface Pressure and Upper Level Winds are available in this simulation. | Spatiotemporal | Causal Discovery | Realistic Simulated 
NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 product | The US National Centers for Environmental Protection (NCEP) and the Department of Energy (DOE) provide this dataset from 1979 to the present time. All available data is applied to a complex climate model to generate reanalysis data for unobserved locations and missing time steps. This is a large set of almost 40 atmospheric variables measured in the reanalysis dataset. The dataset covers 90N-90S, 0E-357.5E with a 2.5-degree latitude x 2.5-degree longitude global grid (144x73).| Spatiotemporal | Causal Discovery | Realistic Simulated
